Welcome to my Cybersecurity journey. As someone who strives to become a better proffessional everyday. I invite you to join me as I document what I have been doing and how I did it.


# SOC Lab Blog

[My first Blog - Wazuh SOC Lab](./blog.md).

In this SOC Lab, I setup an OPNsense firewall VM and created a LAN network to connect other VMs to the WAN.

I then went on to build 4 other VMs to continue to build the lab.

This lab is meant for me to learn how to implement and configure a SOC environment.
